# Quantum Research

During my research at Keio University in the [Naoki Yamamoto Laboratory](https://www.yamamoto.appi.keio.ac.jp/) I am focusing on near-term quantum computing for generative modeling of financial time series. I reproduced and used some methods from current literature, which I will dump in this repo. Hopefully, they are useful to somebody else!

The folder [mps](https://github.com/4d6174686973/quantum-research/tree/main/mps) contains experiments with Matrix Product States.
